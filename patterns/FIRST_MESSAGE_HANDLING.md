# First Message Handling

Use this pattern at the beginning of a new chat or after a context reset.

## Greetings And No-Op Messages

Treat a short greeting, thanks, acknowledgement, or status-neutral message as a
no-op unless it includes an explicit task, path, command, error, or question
that needs project context.

In that case:

- Do not run startup restore.
- Do not read files, summaries, memory, logs, or git state.
- Reply briefly and ask what the user wants to do next.
- If the user then gives a task, restore only the context needed for that task.

## Short Titles

Treat the first user message as a chat title when it looks like a short project
name, feature name, or label rather than an actionable request.

In that case:

- Run only the documented startup context restore.
- Stop after the restore.
- Ask what the user wants to do next.
- Do not execute the title text as a task.

Use judgment. A short first message can still be a real task when it contains an
action verb or an explicit request.

## Shared Instruction Bootstrap

If the first user message is the canonical shared-instruction Git repository
URL, a path to a shared instruction checkout/cache, or a request to connect
shared instructions, treat it as an instruction bootstrap.

If the source repository exposes a root `BOOTSTRAP.md`, read it before
classifying or proposing any Git or project operation. Resolve the target URL
inside a Markdown link before deciding what the request means. Do not require a
specific local drive, checkout folder, or `GENERAL_INSTRUCTIONS_HOME` value when
the canonical GitHub source is available.

Also treat `gi init <source>`, `init <source>`, `инит <source>`, and
`инициализируй <source>` as an instruction bootstrap when the source points to
the canonical repo `https://github.com/Dimosfil/general-instructions.git`, the
shorter GitHub repo form `Dimosfil/general-instructions.git`, the current
shared-instruction checkout/cache, `GENERAL_INSTRUCTIONS_HOME`, or another known
shared-instruction source, even when the source is provided as a Markdown link
and even when the message does not include the `gi` prefix.

Treat `инит правила <source>` the same way when `<source>` points to
`general-instructions`. This means "load or initialize instruction rules from
the existing shared-instruction source," not "create a Git repository."

In that case:

- Read the shared rules needed for bootstrapping.
- Prefer the source checkout's `tools/install-instruction-kit.ps1` for
  deterministic fresh-project setup when it is available. Treat existing local
  instruction files as project-owned and merge them deliberately instead of
  overwriting them.
- Deploy a local instruction kit into the current project from the shared
  templates and checklist.
- When the target path is the active `general-instructions` repository itself,
  follow the repository's `gi start` / `gi restore` startup rules: restore only
  minimal orientation, compact git state, and relevant local instructions, then
  stop and ask what to do next.
- Do not create only a thin `AGENTS.md` that points back to the shared folder.
- Do not add the shared folder as a dependency, package, submodule, symlink, or
  runtime reference unless the user explicitly asks for that.
- Do not read the shared library's `updates/` folder while bootstrapping a
  consuming project.
- Do not reinterpret this form as Git initialization, OpenCode setup, project
  creation, agent creation, or skill creation unless the user explicitly names
  that action.
- Do not create folders, initialize `.git`, or suggest `npm init` /
  `python -m venv` for this form.

## GI Command Prefix

Treat short chat commands that start with `gi` as the local command surface for
the copied `general-instructions` instruction kit in the current project. `gi`
is the only short prefix; do not rename it to `GAI` or another alias.

The main purpose of `gi` commands is token economy and reliable context
restoration: use local instructions, accepted migrations, handoff summaries,
targeted searches, and project memory so the agent does not read the whole
repository or print broad outputs by default.

Examples:

- `gi обновись`: check or apply accepted instruction-kit updates.
- `gi init https://github.com/Dimosfil/general-instructions.git`:
  bootstrap/init from the canonical shared-instruction source repo.
- `gi init Dimosfil/general-instructions.git` or a Markdown link to that repo:
  same bootstrap/init behavior; never replace the current project's git remote
  or run ordinary `git init`.
- `инит https://github.com/Dimosfil/general-instructions.git` or
  `init https://github.com/Dimosfil/general-instructions.git`: same
  bootstrap/startup behavior for the shared instruction source, without
  requiring the `gi` prefix.
- `инит <path-to-general-instructions>`: bootstrap/startup from the existing
  shared-instruction checkout; never run `git init`.
- `инит правила <path-to-general-instructions>`: load instruction rules from the
  existing shared-instruction checkout; never run `git init`.
- `gi commit language: Russian`, `gi коммит язык: Russian`, or
  `ги коммит язык: Russian`: update commit-message language preferences.
- `gi язык коммита: Russian`: older alias for commit-message language
  preferences.
- `gi commit language: English only`: keep English as the only commit-message
  language.
- `gi system language: Russian`, `gi систем язык: Russian`, or
  `ги систем язык: Russian`: update the agent's user-facing working language
  for this project.
- `gi саммари` or `gi summary`: write a handoff summary file under
  `tools/summary/`.
- `gi старт` or `gi restore`: restore project context from `AGENTS.md`, the
  latest handoff summary, and `tools/agent-start.ps1`, then stop and ask what
  to do next.
- `gi start sprint`, `gi sprint start`, or equivalent active-sprint wording:
  restore only the startup context required for task-manager work, then use the
  configured manager contract to take the active Sprint/Cycle into work.
- `gi local sprint`, `gi sprint local`, `gi локальный спринт`,
  `gi спринт локально`, or equivalent explicitly local sprint wording: run a
  local sprint checklist from supplied context or a documented project-local
  checklist location without resolving config-service or changing task-manager
  state.
- `gi sql`, `gi sqlite`, or `gi vector`: inspect project-memory retrieval
  readiness, current metrics, configured activation limits, and stale index
  caveats without deploying external services by default.
- `gi гит-обзор` or `gi git summary`: summarize the latest git commit in the
  current project without printing a full diff.
- `gi тест-план` or `gi test plan`: build a project-aware test plan for a new
  feature, bug fix, or release check.
- `gi коммит`: commit scoped current changes without pushing.
- `gi пуш` or `gi коммит пуш`: commit scoped current changes, then push the
  current branch.
- `gi только пуш`: push existing local commits without creating a new commit.
- `gi пул`, `gi pull`, or `ги пул`: fetch and pull the current branch, resolving
  only clear low-risk conflicts and asking the user when judgment is needed.

Resolve needed `gi` parameters from the current request, established session
choices, and documented project defaults. If a required value remains unknown,
ask one focused question instead of guessing. Do not ask again for an unchanged
value already established for the same target and scope.

Keep the response scoped to the `gi` command. After completing it, summarize only
that command's result and stop. Do not resume an older product task or previous
conversation thread unless the user explicitly asks.

When the user asks where a previous thread stopped or what the current handoff
means, treat handoff summaries as evidence to reconcile with the latest visible
thread conclusion and user-provided screenshots or quotes. Do not answer from
the summary alone when the user supplies a newer or more specific thread ending.
Do not promote incidental caveats, environment variables, skipped checks, or old
next-step bullets into the active task unless they block the stated goal.

Run `gi` commands against the current project root. Do not switch to another
repository, the shared instruction library, or a path from an older task unless
the user explicitly asks. The shared library is only a source of accepted
instruction-kit artifacts.

If a `gi` command needs a file, skill, config, script, endpoint, task, or other
entity that is missing or not found, first reread the relevant local
instructions, runbook, project memory, and accepted instruction-kit artifacts
for that command. If the entity is still missing, ask the user one short
clarification question. Do not use another project folder or the shared
instruction library as a runtime fallback unless the user explicitly gives that
path and action.

## Project Filesystem Boundary

Treat the current project root as the filesystem boundary for `gi` work. Do not
read, search, edit, create, delete, move, or inspect files in another project or
arbitrary external folder just because a task manager, summary, migration, or
previous chat mentions it.

Before filesystem writes, verify that the active working directory, local
project identity, and target path match the user's current request. Use local
identity signals such as local instructions, README title, package or app
manifests, service id, git remote, project-memory orientation, and documented
working areas. If those signals point to a different project than the request,
stop and report the mismatch before editing. A path or product name from old
chat, a screenshot, task-manager metadata, a summary, or a stale plan is not
permission to edit that other project.

Treat `.\others\` under the current workspace parent, or another project-local
relative path named by local instructions, as the standard local parent folder
for third-party projects, cloned external repositories, and vendor experiments
when no more specific destination is provided. This default folder is
configurable: if the user gives another path or project-local instructions
define another third-party workspace parent, use that instead. Do not mix
third-party projects into the current project workspace.

Treat nested checkouts, vendored repositories, cloned examples, and third-party
source trees as separate scope. Do not inspect them as part of the main project
unless the user explicitly asks, the task is about that nested tree, or local
instructions identify it as an active workspace component.

Treat user-home application data and personal telemetry as private external
sources. Do not read `.codex`, `.cursor`, IDE logs, browser profiles, shell
history, application SQLite databases, or local app logs outside the project root
unless the user gives an explicit path and action. Product plans, `apps.txt`,
summaries, and task-manager notes are not filesystem-access permission.

Communicate with external project systems through documented APIs, connectors,
or task-manager endpoints. Use filesystem access outside the current project
only when the user gives an explicit, concrete instruction naming the target
path and action, such as writing a specific file to a specific folder.
